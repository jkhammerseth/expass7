Links to code: all the classes are located in src/main/java

RabbitMQ was easy to install on mac, just used the brew command, and added it to path, 
then running the rabbitmq-server command started the serveron http://localhost:15672. 
Added the dependency in the pom.xml file and reloaded the project. 
Once i figured out the file structure for the different classes everything was running fine. 
Didnt have any big problems, seemed pretty straight forward.
